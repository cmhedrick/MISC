EOW (End of World), is an "End of the World" themed party. The name and acronym stems from "EOF" aka: "End Of File" which shows up in computing when no more data can be extrated form a file. The name and theme also is to pay homage to Mr.Robot (specificly episode 1.10? (1.09 in title)) where an End Of The World party was thrown to Celebrate the 5/9 Hack.
